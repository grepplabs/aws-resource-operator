# AWS Resource Operator

**Note: This is an early alpha stage.**

AWS Resource Operator allows you to manage AWS resources using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions.

In contrast to the [aws-service-operator](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-service-operator), this operator uses AWS APIs directly without CloudFormation, just like the [terraform-provider-aws](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws) does.
